# WELCOME

## About
Driven by a deep passion for innovative technologies, after years of experience in consulting and quality management, I have developed a firm conviction: **technological solutions are not just tools, but fundamental strategic resources for decision-making, driving progress and efficiency in organizations.**

This belief was the driving force behind my career transition to software development, where I see the opportunity to create technological solutions that inspire and truly make a difference.

## Current Learning
I am developing technical knowledge, following the Front-end study path, but soon I will be putting some projects and ideas into practice here.




<!-- Estou entusiasmado em explorar Ã¡reas como automaÃ§Ã£o, telemetria e IoT, e em usar indicadores para otimizar processos e garantir eficiÃªncia.

Busco oportunidades onde eu possa crescer, aprender e contribuir com soluÃ§Ãµes tecnolÃ³gicas criativas e impactantes.

Se vocÃª procura alguÃ©m com uma visÃ£o inovadora e um entusiasmo genuÃ­no por tecnologia, adoraria conversar com vocÃª!
